Simple database webapp to record users food intake and calculate into calories -> (food categories + weight of food in grams = estimated calories)

Calculate user's daily required intake and show some info (how many %)

Take in user's basic info (ID, Username, Age, Height, Weight, Gender, Lifestyle) -> (BMI, daily required calories)

For women, BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 x weight in kg) + (1.850 x height in cm) - (4.676 x age in years)
For men, BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 x weight in kg) + (5.003 x height in cm) - (6.755 x age in years)

Step 2: Calculate Your AMR

Sedentary (little or no exercise): AMR = BMR x 1.2
Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week): AMR = BMR x 1.375
Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week): AMR = BMR x 1.55
Active (exercise 6–7 days/week): AMR = BMR x 1.725
Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week): AMR = BMR x 1.9
